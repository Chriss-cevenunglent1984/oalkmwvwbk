Dude, just watched The Accountant 2 and like, OMG, what even was that?? 😂 Okay, so first off, Ben Affleck was doing his whole silent-but-deadly thing again—classic. But like, the whole plot felt like it was on caffeine and switched gears every five minutes. You following me? Seriously, one minute it's action-packed, then it’s like deep family drama vibes. Make up your mind, movie! 🤦‍♂️

And get this, there was a whole scene that was sooo predictable but I still loved it? Like, can you even? I guess they figured if it ain't broke, don’t fix it. Ha! Oh, did you end up watching the movie with me or did you just download the movie for later? If you did, brace yourself for some wild twists... or just tiny bumps, depends on how you see it, lol.

> There's this moment where I just sat there like, “wait, are they serious?” And then five seconds later, a crazy action scene comes in and I’m wide awake again. 😂 And the villain? Don’t even ask. Half the time, I’m expecting some mind-blowing revelation and then it’s just meh. So anticlimactic, my brain did a facepalm.

Also, what’s with these high-tech math fights or whatever they were?? I felt like I needed a calculator to keep up, or maybe some deep zen to just not care, lol. And there’s still something weirdly satisfying about seeing numbers and fights come together. Maybe it’s just me being a nerd I didn’t know I was. 🤓

Anyway, feels like the writers wanted to mix a thriller with an ASMR session or something, you know what I mean? It clearly needed more... I dunno, more something. Intensity? Drama? Just more! 

int main() { std::cout << Hello, world!; return 0; }

At the end of it all, it's kinda like that confusing but lovable friend who keeps throwing random facts at you, and you just nod along because you’re too tired to care but you’re still invested. Did you ever figure out what the heck was going on? ‘Cause I think I missed half of it while blinking. 😂
